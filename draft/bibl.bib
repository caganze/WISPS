 abstract = {
            Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models. Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.

@article{Spergel2015,
abstract = {This report describes the 2014 study by the Science Definition Team (SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\^{}}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\^{}}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\~{}}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\~{}}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a peculiar L dwarf from the United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey Large Area Survey, ULAS J222711-004547. The very red infrared photometry (MKO J - K = 2.79 ± 0.06, WISE W1-W2 = 0.65 ± 0.05) of ULAS J222711-004547 makes it one of the reddest brown dwarfs discovered so far. We obtained a moderate resolution spectrum of this target using the XSHOOTER spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, and we classify it as L7pec, confirming its very red nature. Comparison to theoretical models suggests that the object could be a low-gravity L dwarf with a solar or higher than solar metallicity. Nonetheless, the match of such fits to the spectral energy distribution is rather poor, and this and other less red peculiar L dwarfs pose new challenges for the modelling of ultracool atmospheres, especially to the understanding of the effects of condensates and their sensitivity to gravity and metallicity. We determined the proper motion of ULAS J222711-004547 using the data available in the literature, and we find that its kinematics do not suggest membership of any of the known young associations. We show that applying a simple de-reddening curve to its spectrum allows it to resemble the spectra of the L7 spectroscopic standards without any spectral features that distinguish it as a low-metallicity or low-gravity dwarf. Given the negligible interstellar reddening of the field containing our target, we conclude that the reddening of the spectrum is mostly due to an excess of dust in the photosphere of the target. De-reddening the spectrum using extinction curves for different dust species gives surprisingly good results and suggests a characteristic grain size of ˜0.5 $\mu$m. We show that by increasing the optical depth, the same extinction curves allow the spectrum of ULAS J222711-004547 to resemble the spectra of unusually blue L dwarfs and even slightly metal-poor L dwarfs. Grains of similar size also yield very good fits when de-reddening other unusually red L dwarfs in the L5-L7.5 range. These results suggest that the diversity in near-infrared colours and spectra seen in late L dwarfs could be due to differences in the optical thickness of the dust cloud deck.},

abstract = {We obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra of seven young M9.5-L3 dwarfs classified in the optical. We aim to confirm the low surface gravity of the objects in the NIR. We also test whether atmospheric models correctly represent the formation and the settling of dust clouds in the atmosphere of young late-M and L dwarfs. We used ISAAC at VLT to obtain the spectra of the targets. We compared them to those of mature and young BD, and young late-type companions to nearby stars with known ages, in order to identify and study gravity-sensitive features. We computed spectral indices weakly sensitive to the surface gravity to derive near-infrared spectral types. Finally, we found the best fit between each spectrum and synthetic spectra from the BT-Settl 2010 and 2013 models. Using the best fit, we derived the atmospheric parameters of the objects and identify which spectral characteristics the models do not reproduce. We confirmed that our objects are young BD and we found NIR spectral types in agreement with the ones determined at optical wavelengths. The spectrum of the L2-gamma dwarf 2MASSJ2322-6151 reproduces well the spectrum of the planetary mass companion 1RXS J1609-2105b. BT-Settl models fit the spectra and the 1-5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m SED of the L0-L3 dwarfs for temperatures between 1600-2000 K. But the models fail to reproduce the shape of the H band, and the NIR slope of some of our targets. This fact, and the best fit solutions found with super-solar metallicity are indicative of a lack of dust, in particular at high altitude, in the cloud models. The modeling of the vertical mixing and of the grain growth will be revised in the next version of the BT-Settl models. These revisions may suppress the remaining non-reproducibilities.},

abstract = {We examine the hypothesis that the red near-infrared colors of some L dwarfs could be explained by a "dust haze" of small particles in their upper atmospheres. This dust haze would exist in conjunction with the clouds found in dwarfs with more typical colors. We developed a model which uses Mie theory and the Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the proposed dust haze. We apply our method to 23 young L dwarfs and 23 red field L dwarfs. We constrain the properties of the dust haze including particle size distribution and column density using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. We find that sub-micron range silicate grains reproduce the observed reddening. Current brown dwarf atmosphere models include large grain (1--100{\~{}}{\$}\backslashmu m{\$}) dust clouds but not submicron dust grains. Our results provide a strong proof of concept and motivate a combination of large and small dust grains in brown dwarf atmosphere models.},

abstract = {We combine optical, near-infrared and mid-infrared spectra and photometry to construct expanded spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 145 field age ($\backslash$textgreater 500 Myr) and 53 young (lower age estimate $\backslash$textless 500 Myr) ultracool dwarfs (M6-T9). This range of spectral types includes very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary mass objects, providing fundamental parameters across both the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses for the largest sample assembled to date. A subsample of 29 objects have well constrained ages as probable members of a nearby young moving group (NYMG). We use 182 parallaxes and 16 kinematic distances to determine precise bolometric luminosities ({\$}L{\_}\backslashtext{\{}bol{\}}{\$}) and radius estimates from evolutionary models give semi-empirical effective temperatures ({\$}T{\_}\backslashtext{\{}eff{\}}{\$}) for the full range of young and field age late-M, L and T dwarfs. We construct age-sensitive relationships of luminosity, temperature and absolute magnitude as functions of spectral type and absolute magnitude to disentangle the effects of degenerate physical parameters such as {\$}T{\_}\backslashtext{\{}eff{\}}{\$}, surface gravity, and clouds on spectral morphology. We report bolometric corrections in {\$}J{\$} for both field age and young objects and find differences of up to a magnitude for late-L dwarfs. Our correction in {\$}Ks{\$} shows a larger dispersion but not necessarily a different relationship for young and field age sequences. We also characterize the NIR-MIR reddening of low gravity L dwarfs and identify a systematically cooler {\$}T{\_}\backslashtext{\{}eff{\}}{\$} of up to 300K from field age objects of the same spectral type and 400K cooler from field age objects of the same {\$}M{\_}H{\$} magnitude.},

Stars in the inner disk ({\$}R{\textless}5{\$} kpc) lie along a single track in [{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}/Fe] vs. [Fe/H], starting with {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at [{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}/Fe]{\$}\backslashsim0{\$} and [Fe/H]{\$}\backslashsim+0.4{\$}. At larger radii we find two distinct sequences in [{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} sequence that merges with the low-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The location of the high-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however there are very few high-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} stars at {\$}R{\textgreater}11{\$} kpc. The peak of the midplane MDF shifts to lower metallicity at larger {\$}R{\$}, reflecting the Galactic metallicity gradient. Most strikingly, the shape of the midplane MDF changes systematically with radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at {\$}3{\textless}R{\textless}7{\$} kpc, to a roughly Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in the outer Galaxy. For stars with {\$}|z|{\textgreater}1{\$} kpc or [{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}/Fe]{\$}{\textgreater}0.18{\$}, the MDF shows little dependence on {\$}R{\$}. The positive skewness of the outer disk MDF may be a signature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations by orbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of MDF shape but a simple model of radial migration can do so.},

We use the BANYAN {\{}$\backslash$Sigma{\}} kinematic analysis tool to identify 1,015 individual stars in the Oh17 catalog that yielded a {\textgreater}80{\%} probability in one of 27 known associations (e.g. the AB Doradus moving group, Columba, Upper Scorpius) in the vicinity of the Sun.

We use a combination of Tycho, Gaia, 2MASS, WISE, Galex, and ROSAT photometry as well as Gaia parallaxes to determine that these new groups are likely older than the Pleiades but younger than {\~{}}1 Gyr. Using isochrone fitting we find that the majority of these new groups have solar type stars and solar type metallicity. Among the 35 Oh17 groups with 5 - 9 members, we find that 19 also appear new and co-moving, with one group well within 100pc (range of 77 - 90 pc). For known star forming regions, open clusters, and moving groups identified by Oh17, we find that the majority were broken up into pieces over several Oh17 groups (e.g. Lower Centaurus Crux members are spread over 26 Oh17 groups) however we found no correlation with positions of the groups on color magnitude diagrams therefore no substructure of the association correlated with the Oh17 designated group. We find that across the 27 groups tested by BANYAN {\{}$\backslash$Sigma{\}} there were 400 new members to 20 different associations uncovered by Oh17 that require further vetting.},

@article{RyanJr.2016a,
abstract = {We present predictions for the surface density of ultracool dwarfs (with spectral types M8–T8) for a host of deep fields that are likely to be observed with the James Webb Space Telescope. Based on simple thin and thick/thin disk (exponential) models, we show that the typical distance modulus is 9.8 m » mag, which at high Galactic latitude is z 5 log 2 5 scl () -. Since this is a property of the density distribution of an exponential disk, it is independent of spectral type or stellar sample. Using the published estimates of the ultracool dwarf luminosity function, we show that their number counts typically peak around J 24 {\~{}} mag with a total surface density of 0.3 S {\~{}} arcmin −2 , but with a strong dependence on galactic coordinate and spectral type. Owing to the exponential shape of the disk, the ultracool dwarfs are very rare at faint magnitudes (J 27  mag), with typical densities of 0.005 S {\~{}} arcmin −2 (or 20 {\~{}} {\%} of the total contribution within the field). Therefore, in very narrow and deep fields, we predict there are only a few ultracool dwarfs, and hence these stars are likely not a severe contaminant in searches for high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, the ultracool dwarfs are expected to be considerably brighter than the high-redshift galaxies, so samples near the faint end of the high-redshift galaxy population will be the purest. We present the star-count formalism in a simplified way so that observers may easily predict the number of stars for their conditions (field, depth, wavelength, etc.).},

abstract = {Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) is a powerful UV/visible/near-infrared camera that has just completed development for installation into the Hubble Space Telescope during upcoming Servicing Mission 4. WFC3 provides two imaging channels. The UVIS channel incorporates a 4102 × 4096 pixel CCD focal plane with sensitivity from 200 to 1000 nm and a 162 × 162 arcsec field of view. The UVIS channel features unprecedented sensitivity and field of view in the near ultraviolet for HST, as well as a rich filter set that complements the visible capabilities of the HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys, whose repair will be attempted in the Servicing Mission. The IR channel features a 1024 × 1024 pixel HgCdTe focal plane covering 850 to 1700 nm with a 136 × 123 arcsec field of view, providing a major advance in IR survey efficiency for HST. We report here on the design of the instrument, on recent activities that have completed the integration of the instrument for flight, and on results of the ground test and calibration program.},

Folding in constraints based on the spectral types of the components (L4{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.7 and T5.5{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.1), corresponding effective temperatures, and brown dwarf evolutionary models, we further constrain the orbital inclination of this system to be nearly edge-on (90{\$}{\^{}}o\backslashpm{\$}19{\$}{\^{}}o{\$}), and deduce a large system mass ratio (M{\$}{\_}2{\$}/M{\$}{\_}1{\$} = 0.86{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+0.10{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.12{\}}{\$}), substellar components (M{\$}{\_}1{\$} = 0.057{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+0.016{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.014{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, M{\$}{\_}2{\$} = 0.048{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+0.008{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.010{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), and a relatively old system age (minimum age = 4.0{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+1.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.2{\}}{\$} Gyr). The measured projected rotational velocity of the primary ({\$}v\backslashsin{\{}i{\}}{\$} = 34.1{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.7 km/s) implies that this inactive source is a rapid rotator (period {\$}\backslashlesssim{\$} 3 hr) and a viable system for testing spin-orbit alignment in very-low-mass multiples.

abstract = {[Abbreviated] We present the results of a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic follow-up survey of 182 M4-L7 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) from the BANYAN All-Sky Survey (BASS) for candidate members of nearby, young moving groups (YMGs). We confirm signs of low-gravity for 42 new BD discoveries with estimated masses between 8-75 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$} and identify previously unrecognized signs of low gravity for 24 known BDs. This allows us to refine the fraction of low-gravity dwarfs in the high-probability BASS sample to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}82{\%}. We use this unique sample of 66 young BDs, supplemented with 22 young BDs from the literature, to construct new empirical NIR absolute magnitude and color sequences for low-gravity BDs. We obtain a spectroscopic confirmation of low-gravity for 2MASS J14252798-3650229, which is a new {\$}\backslashsim{\$}27 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, L4 {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} bona fide member of AB Doradus. We identify a total of 19 new low-gravity candidate members of YMGs with estimated masses below 13 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, seven of which have kinematically estimated distances within 40 pc. These objects will be valuable benchmarks for a detailed atmospheric characterization of planetary-mass objects with the next generation of instruments. We find 16 strong candidate members of the Tucana-Horologium association with estimated masses between 12.5-14 {\$}M{\_}{\{}Jup{\}}{\$}, a regime where our study was particularly sensitive. This would indicate that for this association there is at least one isolated object in this mass range for every {\$}17.5{\_}{\{}-5.0{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+6.6{\}}{\$} main-sequence stellar member, a number significantly higher than expected based on standard log-normal initial mass function, however in the absence of radial velocity and parallax measurements for all of them, it is likely that this over-density is caused by a number of young interlopers from other moving groups. We identify 12 new L0-L5 field BDs, seven of which display peculiar properties.},

abstract = {A determination of the initial mass function (IMF) of the current, incomplete census of the 10 Myr-old TW Hya association (TWA) is presented. This census is built from a literature compilation supplemented with new spectra and 17 new radial velocities, as well as a re-analysis of Hipparcos data that confirmed HR 4334 (A2Vn) as a member. Though the dominant uncertainty in the IMF remains census incompleteness, a detailed statistical treatment is carried out to make the IMF determination independent of binning, while accounting for small number statistics. The currently known high-likelihood members are fitted by a log-normal distribution with a central mass of {\$}0.21{\^{}}{\{}+0.11{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.06{\}}{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and a characteristic width of {\$}0.8{\^{}}{\{}+0.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.1{\}}{\$} dex in the 12 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}-2 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} range, whereas a Salpeter power law with {\$}\backslashalpha = 2.2{\^{}}{\{}+1.1{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.5{\}}{\$} best describes the IMF slope in the {\$}0.1-2{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} range. This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which may be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A tentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2MASS J11472421-2040204 and 2MASS J11193254-1137466 is identified: this indicates that there might be as many as {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}+13{\}}{\_}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} similar members of TWA with hot-start model-dependent masses estimated at {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 5-7 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Jup{\}}{\$}, most of which would be too faint to be detected in 2MASS. Our new radial velocity measurements corroborate the membership of 2MASS J11472421-2040204, and secure TWA 28 (M8.5{\$}\backslashgamma{\$}), TWA 29 (M9.5{\$}\backslashgamma{\$}) and TWA 33 (M4.5e) as members. The discovery of 2MASS J09553336-0208403, a young L7-type interloper unrelated to TWA, is also presented.},

abstract = {Context. Thanks to recent and ongoing large scale surveys, hundreds of brown dwarfs have been discovered in the last decade. The Canada-France Brown Dwarf Survey is a wide-field survey for cool brown dwarfs conducted with the MegaCam camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope telescope. Aims. Our objectives are to find ultracool brown dwarfs and to constrain the field brown-dwarf luminosity function and the mass function from a large and homogeneous sample of L and T dwarfs. Methods. We identify candidates in CFHT/MegaCam i' and z' images and follow them up with pointed near infrared (NIR) imaging on several telescopes. Halfway through our survey we found {\~{}}50 T dwarfs and {\~{}}170 L or ultra cool M dwarfs drawn from a larger sample of 1400 candidates with typical ultracool dwarfs i' - z' colours, found in 780 square degrees. Results. We have currently completed the NIR follow-up on a large part of the survey for all candidates from mid-L dwarfs down to the latest T dwarfs known with utracool dwarfs' colours. This allows us to draw on a complete and well defined sample of 102 ultracool dwarfs to investigate the luminosity function and space density of field dwarfs. Conclusions. We found the density of late L5 to T0 dwarfs to be 2.0pm0.8 x 10-3 objects pc-3, the density of T0.5 to T5.5 dwarfs to be 1.4pm0.3 x 10-3 objects pc-3, and the density of T6 to T8 dwarfs to be 5.3pm3.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3 . We found that these results agree better with a flat substellar mass function. Three latest dwarfs at the boundary between T and Y dwarfs give the high density 8.3p9.0m5.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3. Although the uncertainties are very large this suggests that many brown dwarfs should be found in this late spectral type range, as expected from the cooling of brown dwarfs, whatever their mass, down to very low temperature.},

@article{brieman2001,
  Abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{brieman1997,
  Abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},
